                                                               Java Mail Wrapper

1- public class JavaMailWrapper extends Email {: This line declares a class called JavaMailWrapper which extends the Email class. In Java, the extends keyword is used to create a subclass that inherits properties and methods from the superclass (Email in this case).

2- protected static Log sLog = LogFactory.getLog(Email.class);: This line declares a static variable sLog of type Log, which is a logger object from the Apache Commons Logging framework. The LogFactory.getLog(Email.class) statement initializes the logger with the name of the Email class. The logger is used for logging messages.

3-@Override: This annotation indicates that the method that follows is intended to override a method in the superclass or implement an interface.
 In this case, it is used to override the send() method inherited from the Email class.

4-public void send() throws MessagingException, UnsupportedEncodingException {: This line defines the send() method, which is responsible for sending the email. It throws two exceptions: MessagingException and UnsupportedEncodingException, indicating that these exceptions can occur during the execution of the method.

5-long t0 = System.currentTimeMillis();: This line records the current time in milliseconds and assigns it to the variable t0. It is used to measure the execution time of the email sending process.

6-try { ... } finally { ... }: This construct is used for exception handling. The code within the try block contains the existing code to send
the email, which is not shown in the provided snippet. The finally block ensures that the code inside it is always executed, regardless of 
whether an exception occurs or not.

7-sLog.info("Email sent successfully.");: This line logs an informational message using the logger sLog. It indicates that the email was sent successfully.

8-long t = System.currentTimeMillis() - t0;: This line calculates the time elapsed for sending the email by subtracting the value of t0 
(recorded at the start) from the current time.

9-if (t > 30000) ... else if (t > 5000) ...: These conditional statements check the value of t (execution time) and determine the appropriate 
log level to use for logging the execution time. If the execution time exceeds 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds), a warning message is logged. 
If it exceeds 5,000 milliseconds (5 seconds) but is less than or equal to 30,000 milliseconds, an informational message is logged.
